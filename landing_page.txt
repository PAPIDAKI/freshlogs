What is a microlot?
Microlot is a delivery  of fresh produce  from the field into the packhouse  for packing.

After cutting crop is sent for sorting and packing 
This batch from the field to the packhouse is a microlot and this is what we are tracing 
Each microlot has a distinct number assigned telling field date and time of entrance to the packhouse 
In case there is a problem we can trace back if it was a 
field problem maybe a certain area of the field needs more ground nutrients oe maybe it was a bad handling during transportation from the field into the packhouse 
Field > Local Tranport > Packhouse > Storage > Transportation > Importer
